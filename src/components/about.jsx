          My name is Alexandre Moreira, I am a frontend developer from Portugal,
          living in Sweden.

          After a decade working in the Music Industry as a musician, producer
          and engineer, I decided to pivot to web development. With the help and
          encouragement of many friends and acquaintances who work in the
          industry, I started studying JavaScript ES6, HTML and CSS, completing
          an online “Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp” by Colt Steele, as
          well as “JavaScript for Beginners” and “Object-oriented Programming in
          JavaScript” by Mosh Hamedani. I quickly became aware of the industry’s
          preference for React.js, and so decided to do a course called
          “Mastering React”, also by Mosh Hamedani. It quickly became my
          prefered way of working, and it allowed me the possibility of working
          with large libraries of data and information that can be effortless
          and dynamically displayed. I started making websites for friends and
          joined a web and app development startup called Dinsdag.se, who are
          currently working with health care entities.
